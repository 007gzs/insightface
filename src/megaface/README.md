Please strictly follow these rules if you want to use our MegaFace noises list.

* Please cite our paper and git repo if you want to use this list in your paper.
* Please include the information like `We used the noises list proposed by InsightFace, at https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/src/megaface` if you want to submit the result to MegaFace challenge.
* To be fair, if you want to submit MegaFace result, please remove the FaceScrub-overlapped identities from your training set if cosine similarity is larger than 0.4 with FaceScrub identities(by using centre feature vector).
* If you find more overlaps noise, please open an issue at InsightFace.
